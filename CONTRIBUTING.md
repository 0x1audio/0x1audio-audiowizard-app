# Contributing

Thank you for helping with Pitch & Tempo, an official Mixel app. A good bug report is as welcome as a pull request.

## Issues

- **Bugs:** say what you did, what you expected, and what happened instead. Add your OS, the version or commit, and any error text.
- **Ideas and bigger changes:** open an issue before you write the code, so we can agree on the shape first.
- **Security problems:** please don't open a public issue. [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) explains how to tell us privately.
- **Mixel itself, your account or Plus:** Mixel isn't developed in this repository. In Mixel, choose **Help › Send Feedback…**, or see [0x1audio.com/help](https://0x1audio.com/help).

## Set up

You build against the Mixel you already use, with the `mixel` command. You don't need Mixel's own source code. You need:

- **Mixel**, on a Mac with macOS 14 or later, from [0x1audio.com/download](https://0x1audio.com/download).
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)**, which brings its own Python.

In Mixel, turn on **Settings › Developer mode**, then quit and reopen Mixel. Install the `mixel` command once (it's [`ox1audio`](https://pypi.org/project/ox1audio/) on PyPI), and open your clone in Mixel:

```bash
uv tool install ox1audio
git clone https://github.com/0x1audio/0x1audio-audiowizard-app.git 0x1audio-audiowizard-app
cd 0x1audio-audiowizard-app
mixel doctor   # says what's missing, if anything
mixel dev      # opens it in Mixel and reloads it on save
```

`mixel dev` opens your copy in Mixel, marked **In development**. It reloads when you save, and prints the app's log and errors in your terminal. Press Ctrl-C to close it.

### The page

The page is a Vite + React app in `src/`. Mixel opens the built copy, `dist/index.html`, which is committed, so a change to the Python alone needs no Node.

The page builds with two Mixel packages from npm: the page SDK ([`@ox1audio/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ox1audio/sdk)) and Mixel's design system ([`@ox1audio/design-system`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ox1audio/design-system)). To rebuild it you need [Node](https://nodejs.org) 20.19 or later and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io):

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build   # checks the types, then writes dist/
```

## Run the checks

Run these before you open a pull request:

```bash
uv sync       # once: the app's Python packages, so the tests can run
mixel check   # app.json and the action, the way Mixel and its reviewers read them
mixel test    # the tests in tests/
```

A change to `src/` comes with a rebuilt `dist/` (`pnpm build`), so the page Mixel opens matches its source.

## Pull requests

- Keep each pull request to one change, and say what changed and why.
- Add or update tests with the change.
- For anything on screen, add screenshots in light and dark.
- Sign off every commit (see below).

A maintainer reviews every pull request. We may ask for changes; that's normal, and it's about the code, never about you.

**Written with a coding agent?** That's welcome, and the bar is the same. You've read the change, you've run the checks yourself, and the sign-off is yours: you're the one saying you have the right to contribute it. `mixel mcp` keeps an agent on the rules.

## Sign off your commits (DCO)

We use the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org) (DCO) instead of a contributor licence agreement. You keep the copyright on your work. By signing off, you confirm you have the right to contribute it.

Add `-s` when you commit:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Explain the change"
```

Git adds a line with your name and email from `git config`:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
```

Use your real name, or the name you're known by in open source. Forgot one? `git commit --amend -s` fixes the last commit, and `git rebase --signoff main` fixes every commit on your branch. Then force-push the branch.

A check on every pull request reads the commits and fails if one isn't signed off. `sh .github/dco-check.sh origin/main` runs the same check on your computer.

## Your contribution's licence

Everything you contribute is licensed under **Apache-2.0**, the same licence as the rest of this repository ([LICENSE](LICENSE)). There is no separate agreement and no relicensing.

## The bar

**Code.** Small and readable beats clever. Every change comes with its tests, the checks above pass, and no secrets go into the repository.

**Design.** Anything on screen follows [Mixel's design system for apps](https://docs.0x1audio.com/design-system): its tokens, type, the 4 px spacing grid, motion and words. On top of that, our craft bar:

- Start from real content: real file names, long titles, and 0, 1 or 10,000 items.
- Give each view one clear primary action.
- Design every state: hover, pressed, focus-visible, disabled, loading, empty, error, and text that overflows. Keyboard first.
- Motion is short and explains what changed.
- Write plain, specific copy. Use a verb that says what the button does, never "Submit".
- None of the usual tells: gradient text, glows, cards inside cards, borders everywhere, or emoji as icons.

## How we treat each other

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). In short: be kind, talk about the work and not the person, and assume the other person is trying to help. If something isn't right, write to [hello@0x1audio.com](mailto:hello@0x1audio.com); it's read by a person and kept private.

## The name

The code is open, and the name "Mixel" and its marks are protected so people know what's official. See the [trademark policy](https://0x1audio.com/trademarks).
