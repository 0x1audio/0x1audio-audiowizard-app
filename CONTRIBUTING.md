# Contributing

Thank you for helping with Pitch & Tempo, an official Mixel app. A good bug report is as welcome as a pull request.

## Issues

- **Bugs:** say what you did, what you expected, and what happened instead. Add your OS, the version or commit, and any error text.
- **Ideas and bigger changes:** open an issue before you write the code, so we can agree on the shape first.
- **Security problems:** please don't open a public issue. [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) explains how to tell us privately.

## Set up

You build against the Mixel you already use, with the `mixel` command. You don't need Mixel's own source code. You need:

- **Mixel**, from [0x1audio.com](https://0x1audio.com).
- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)**, which brings its own Python.
- **Node 22 or later and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)**, only if you change the page.

In Mixel, turn on **Settings › Developer mode**, then quit and reopen Mixel. Install the `mixel` command once, and open your clone in Mixel:

```bash
uv tool install ox1audio
git clone https://github.com/0x1audio/0x1audio-audiowizard-app.git 0x1audio-audiowizard-app
cd 0x1audio-audiowizard-app
mixel doctor   # says what's missing, if anything
mixel dev      # opens it in Mixel and reloads it on save
```

`mixel dev` opens your copy in Mixel, marked **In development**. It reloads when you save, and prints the app's log and errors in your terminal. Press Ctrl-C to close it.

### The page

The page is a Vite + React app in `src/`. Mixel opens the built copy, `dist/index.html`, which is committed, so a change to the Python alone needs no Node.

To change the page, install its packages, then keep a build running next to `mixel dev`. Each time the build writes `dist/`, Mixel reloads the page:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm exec vite build --watch
```

`pnpm install` brings the page SDK (`@0x1audio/sdk`) and Mixel's design system (`@0x1audio/design-system`) from npm.

## Run the checks

Run these before you open a pull request:

```bash
uv sync       # once: the app's Python packages, so the tests can run
mixel check   # app.json and the action, the way Mixel and its reviewers read them
mixel test    # the tests in tests/
pnpm build    # if you changed the page: type-checks it and rebuilds dist/
```

Commit `dist/` with every change to `src/`, so the page Mixel opens matches its source.

## Pull requests

- Keep each pull request to one change, and say what changed and why.
- Add or update tests with the change.
- For anything on screen, add screenshots in light and dark.
- Sign off every commit (see below).

A maintainer reviews every pull request. We may ask for changes; that's normal, and it's about the code, never about you.

## Sign off your commits (DCO)

We use the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org) (DCO) instead of a contributor licence agreement. You keep the copyright on your work. By signing off, you confirm you have the right to contribute it.

Add `-s` when you commit:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Explain the change"
```

Git adds a line with your name and email from `git config`:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
```

Use your real name, or the name you're known by in open source. Forgot one? `git commit --amend -s` fixes the last commit, and `git rebase --signoff main` fixes every commit on your branch. Then force-push the branch.

## Your contribution's licence

Everything you contribute is licensed under **Apache-2.0**, the same licence as the rest of this repository ([LICENSE](LICENSE)). There is no separate agreement and no relicensing.

## The bar

**Code.** Small and readable beats clever. Every change comes with its tests, the checks above pass, and no secrets go into the repository.

**Design.** Anything on screen follows Mixel's design system: [Design for apps](https://developers.0x1audio.com/design) and [the components](https://developers.0x1audio.com/reference/components), with their tokens, type, the 4 px spacing grid, motion and words. On top of that, our craft bar:

- Start from real content: real file names, long titles, and 0, 1 or 10,000 items.
- Give each view one clear primary action.
- Design every state: hover, pressed, focus-visible, disabled, loading, empty, error, and text that overflows. Keyboard first.
- Motion is short and explains what changed.
- Write plain, specific copy. Use a verb that says what the button does, never "Submit".
- None of the usual tells: gradient text, glows, cards inside cards, borders everywhere, or emoji as icons.

## The name

The code is open, and the name "Mixel" and its marks are protected so people know what's official. See [TRADEMARKS.md](https://github.com/0x1audio/cloud/blob/main/TRADEMARKS.md).
