# Contributing

Thank you for helping with Pitch & Tempo, an official Mixel app. A good bug report is as welcome as a pull request.

## Issues

- **Bugs:** say what you did, what you expected, and what happened instead. Add your OS, the version or commit, and any error text.
- **Ideas and bigger changes:** open an issue before you write the code, so we can agree on the shape first.
- **Security problems:** please don't open a public issue. [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) explains how to tell us privately.

## Set up

This app links `@0x1audio/design-system` and `@0x1audio/sdk` from sibling checkouts, so clone those next to it first:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0x1audio/cloud.git 0x1audio-cloud
git clone https://github.com/0x1audio/0x1audio-audiowizard-app.git 0x1audio-audiowizard-app
cd 0x1audio-audiowizard-app
pnpm install
```

The page SDK, `0x1audio-sdk-ts`, isn't on GitHub yet. Until it is, open an issue and we'll help you get set up.

## Run the checks

Run these before you open a pull request:

```bash
pnpm build
uv run --group dev python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Pull requests

- Keep each pull request to one change, and say what changed and why.
- Add or update tests with the change.
- For anything on screen, add screenshots in light and dark.
- Sign off every commit (see below).

A maintainer reviews every pull request. We may ask for changes; that's normal, and it's about the code, never about you.

## Sign off your commits (DCO)

We use the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org) (DCO) instead of a contributor licence agreement. You keep the copyright on your work. By signing off, you confirm you have the right to contribute it.

Add `-s` when you commit:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Explain the change"
```

Git adds a line with your name and email from `git config`:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>
```

Use your real name, or the name you're known by in open source. Forgot one? `git commit --amend -s` fixes the last commit, and `git rebase --signoff main` fixes every commit on your branch. Then force-push the branch.

## Your contribution's licence

Everything you contribute is licensed under **Apache-2.0**, the same licence as the rest of this repository ([LICENSE](LICENSE)). There is no separate agreement and no relicensing.

## The bar

**Code.** Small and readable beats clever. Every change comes with its tests, the checks above pass, and no secrets go into the repository.

**Design.** Anything on screen follows [DESIGN.md](https://github.com/0x1audio/cloud/blob/main/packages/design-system/DESIGN.md) in the design system: its tokens, type, the 4 px spacing grid, motion and words. On top of that, our craft bar:

- Start from real content: real file names, long titles, and 0, 1 or 10,000 items.
- Give each view one clear primary action.
- Design every state: hover, pressed, focus-visible, disabled, loading, empty, error, and text that overflows. Keyboard first.
- Motion is short and explains what changed.
- Write plain, specific copy. Use a verb that says what the button does, never "Submit".
- None of the usual tells: gradient text, glows, cards inside cards, borders everywhere, or emoji as icons.

## The name

The code is open, and the name "Mixel" and its marks are protected so people know what's official. See the [trademark policy](https://0x1audio.com/trademarks).
